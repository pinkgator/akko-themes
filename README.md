# akko-themes
A repository for my Akkoma themes.

To download, hit Code > Download Zip and extract the zip once that's done.
To use them, go to your instance, open Settings > Theme (paintbrush icon on mobile) > Load Theme and select the one you want.

I still haven't figured out how to copy from the git repository into your themes folder so if anyone knows of a stupid people-friendly tutorial for that, please let me know and I'll link it here.
